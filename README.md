# Logistic regression model

This is a made from scratch logistic regression model based on the course Neural Networks and Deep learning by Andrew Ng.

The dataset used to train and test the model was gathered from Kaggle ([Cat and Dog dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog))

## Technical details

The current version of this repo's algorithm is its first iteration. Therefore, a lot of improvements can and will be made (ToDo...).

learning_rate used = 0.0005
